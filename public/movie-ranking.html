    <h1>The Best Movies According to Habeeb</h1>
    <h2>My top 3 movies of all-time.</h2>
    <hr>
    
    <h3>The Healer</h3>
    <p>This has been one of my favorite korean movies so far <br />
    and it is also part of my inspiration to learning programming <br /> 
    because it is like a movie with fight and hacking processes and <br />
    ability to think critically in a bad condition or in any situation one you got into.</p>
    
    <h3>My Love From Another Star</h3>
    <p>This movie has always been interesting to me since the first <br />
       day I got to watch it and I have got to keep watching it tons of time <br />
       because of the magical aspect of it and it is more like a movie that talks about science and history.

    <h3>K2</h3>
    <p>I was actually going through Netflix some days and fortunately, <br />
       I came across this movie and what got me attracted to the movie was because of a main cast in it.</p>
